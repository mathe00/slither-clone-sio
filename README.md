## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Deep Dive
Some key mechanisms explained:

*   **Snake Rendering (WebGL):**
    Each snake is represented by an array of segments (`trail`). The current WebGL renderer (`game-renderer.js`) draws each segment as a colored quad. The size of the segments (`segmentRadius`) and head (`headRadius`) is calculated dynamically based on the player's `maxTrailLength` (logarithmically for a pleasant visual effect). Eyes are also drawn procedurally as overlapping quads. Rendering uses matrices (Model-View-Projection) managed by `webgl-utils.js` to position, orient, and scale each part.

*   **Trail Effects (Particles):**
    The `trail-effects.js` module defines "spawner" functions for each effect type. When a snake moves (and depending on the effect chosen in `skinData`), `game-main.js` periodically calls the appropriate spawn function. This function generates data for one or more particles (initial position, velocity, lifespan, color, size, type). These particles are stored in the `particles` array of the player object. The rendering loop (`game-renderer.js`) updates the position and opacity of each particle and draws them (often as simple quads with additive blending for glow effects).

*   **Real-time Communication (Socket.IO & Alternatives):**
    Socket.IO is currently used for bidirectional communication. It handles sending client inputs, broadcasting the game state (via AoI), notifications, etc.
    *   **Client -> Server:** `mouse_move`, `boost`, `joinGame`, `clientCollisionDetected` (`low` mode), admin actions...
    *   **Server -> Client(s):** `state`, `leaderboard`, `gameOver`, `mapSizeUpdate`, `adminMessage`, various notifications...
    *   **Scalability:** For a very large number of concurrent players, Socket.IO (based on TCP) could become a bottleneck. Alternatives like **WebRTC** (for P2P or via SFU) or **WebTransport** (based on HTTP/3 and QUIC, allowing unreliable and ordered/unordered UDP streams) could offer superior performance but would significantly complicate the network architecture.

*   **Collision Detection & Security Modes (`high` vs `low`):**
    The server can operate in two distinct security modes, configurable via `config.json` or the admin panel (`/admin`), primarily affecting collision handling and anti-cheat:
    *   **`high` Mode (Recommended):** This is the default mode, designed for the best security and fairness.
        *   **Head-Body Collision:** Detection is performed **server-side** authoritatively. Dedicated workers (`collisionWorker.js`) calculate the distance between a player's head and the **line segments** forming the trail of nearby opponents (point-segment detection, more precise). The server solely determines if a collision occurred.
        *   **Anti-Cheat (Teleportation):** The server uses a **standard** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR`) to detect suspicious movements, making it more sensitive to teleportation cheat attempts.
        *   **Security Improvement Ideas:** Even stricter validation of client inputs, detection of suspicious movement patterns (bots, macros), analysis of action consistency over time.
        *   **Usage:** Ideal for public servers or when fairness and cheat prevention are priorities. üëç
    *   **`low` Mode (Client + Lightweight / Insecure):** This mode delegates part of the logic to the client to reduce server load, at the cost of security.
        *   **Head-Body Collision:** Detection is performed **client-side** (`game-main.js`). The player's browser checks if its own head touches the points of other players' trails (point-point detection, less precise). If a collision is detected, the client sends a `clientCollisionDetected` message to the server. **The server trusts this message** and triggers the player's death without performing its own collision check via workers.
        *   **Anti-Cheat (Teleportation):** The server uses an **increased** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR * 1.2`) to detect suspicious movements, reducing the risk of kicking legitimate players due to lag but making cheat detection less effective.
        *   **Performance Improvement Ideas:** Send less data in `state` messages (e.g., simplified trails for distant players?), use binary data formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, MessagePack) instead of JSON to reduce message size.
        *   **Usage:** Primarily intended for **debugging**, testing, or private games among trusted players. **This mode is inherently insecure and highly vulnerable to cheating**, as a modified client can simply choose not to send the collision message. ‚ö†Ô∏è
    *   **Optimization (Workers & Spatial Grid):** In both modes, the server uses a `SpatialGrid` to optimize nearby entity searches. In `high` mode, this data is then sent to `worker_threads` for precise head-body collision calculations, avoiding blocking the main Node.js thread.

*   **Skin System:**
    Skin information is stored in the `skinData` object within `accounts.json` for registered players.
    ```json
    "skinData": {
      "bodyType": "pattern", // "single" or "pattern"
      "bodyColor": "#44ff00", // Base color or for 'single' type
      "patternColors": ["#b739f4", "#9fc93f", ...], // Array of colors for 'pattern'
      "trailEffect": "glitch" // Name of the trail effect
    }
    ```
    This data is sent to the client during `joinGame` (for logged-in players) or directly by the client (for temporary players). The server includes it in `state` messages. The client (`game-renderer.js`) uses `skinData` to choose how to draw the body (single color or alternating `patternColors`), and `game-main.js` uses it to trigger the correct particle effect via `trail-effects.js`. The head color (`headColor`) is stored separately in `accounts.json` but managed alongside `skinData` in forms and the `/updateSkin` API.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Future Ideas
This project is a solid foundation, but here are some potential improvements and planned fixes:

### ‚úÖ To-Do (Priority)
*   **Optimization & Scalability:**
    *   [ ] **Socket Performance:** Evaluate and potentially enhance the Socket.IO server's capacity to handle a large number of concurrent players.
        *   *Ideas:* Node.js profiling, message optimization (frequency, size, binary format?), clustering Node.js, consider WebTransport/WebRTC for >1000 player scenarios?
    *   [ ] **AoI (Area of Interest) Precision:** Currently, AoI only considers the *head* position of other players. A player whose tail is the only part within the AoI won't be visible, potentially causing unfair deaths.
        *   *Approach 1:* Send the full data of a player as soon as *any* part of their body (trail) enters the client's AoI. Simple but potentially higher bandwidth usage.
        *   *Approach 2:* Send only the *part* of the trail that is visible within the AoI. More complex to manage server and client-side (truncating/reconstructing trails) but more bandwidth-efficient.
*   **UI (User Interface):**
    *   [ ] **Simplify Main Menu:** Reorganize/group buttons for a less cluttered and more intuitive interface.
    *   [ ] **Restore Admin Panel Tabs:** Reintegrate missing tabs (likely related to specific features removed or planned).
*   **Gameplay:**
    *   [ ] **Boost Particle Consistency:** Particles generated during boost should have the same appearance/type as standard food or be a distinct but visually consistent type.

### ‚è≥ Future Improvements (Lower Priority)
*   [ ] **Rendering Engine Migration:**
    *   [ ] Explore migrating the client-side rendering from the current custom WebGL implementation to a dedicated game framework like **Phaser**.
    *   *Rationale:* Phaser could simplify development (scene management, sprites, physics helpers), potentially offer comparable or better performance depending on usage, and benefit from a larger community and ecosystem. This would involve a significant refactor of `game-renderer.js`, `webgl-utils.js`, and parts of `game-main.js`.
*   [ ] **Advanced Gameplay:**
    *   [ ] Add optional power-ups (temporary invincibility, food magnet, etc.) configurable via the admin panel.
    *   [ ] Create a Battle Royale mode with a progressively shrinking zone.
*   [ ] **Internationalization (i18n):**
    *   [ ] Implement a translation system for all user-visible text (labels, messages, UI elements, etc.).
    *   *Target Languages:* English, French, Spanish, German, and potentially more. üåç
    *   *Ideas:* Use an i18n library (like `i18next`) with JSON translation files per language. Detect browser language or allow user selection.
*   [ ] **Code Refactoring & Cleanup:**
    *   [ ] Full code review to improve comments (in English), remove obsolete development comments ("FIN modification", "ajout ici", etc.).
    *   [ ] Ensure consistent JSDoc documentation for important functions.
    *   [ ] Standardize code style further if necessary.
