**üîß Architecture & Tech Stack:**
*   **Modular Node.js Backend:** Organized code (`apiRoutes.js`, `gameLogic.js`, `socketHandlers.js`, `serverLifecycle.js`). **Sends i18next keys** to the client for localized messages.
*   **Modular JavaScript Client:** Separated logic (`game-main.js`, `game-renderer.js`, `webgl-utils.js`, `ui-logic.js`, `sound-manager.js`, `trail-effects.js`, `admin-logic.js`). **`ui-logic.js` and `admin-logic.js` handle i18next initialization and UI text rendering.**
*   **Clean Express API:** Dedicated routes for authentication, customization, administration. **API responses use i18next keys for feedback.**
*   **Performance Optimizations:**
    *   `worker_threads` for intensive collision calculations.
    *   Spatial Grid (`SpatialGrid`) to optimize nearby entity searches.
    *   Area of Interest (AoI): Only sends relevant data around the client.
    *   Optimized WebGL rendering.
*   **Server Lifecycle Management:** Clean startup/shutdown, `server.lock` management.
*   **Flexible Configuration:** Server and game settings managed via `config.json`.
*   **Data Persistence:** Accounts (`accounts.json`) and sessions (`sessions.json`) saved.
*   **Internationalization:** `i18next` library with JSON files in `/public/locales/`.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Service Worker (`service-worker.js`) caches core assets, **including locale files and i18next libraries**, for offline functionality (localized offline page).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Deep Dive
Some key mechanisms explained:

*   **Snake Rendering (WebGL):**
    Each snake is represented by an array of segments (`trail`). The current WebGL renderer (`game-renderer.js`) draws each segment as a colored quad. The size of the segments (`segmentRadius`) and head (`headRadius`) is calculated dynamically based on the player's `maxTrailLength` (logarithmically for a pleasant visual effect). Eyes are also drawn procedurally as overlapping quads. Rendering uses matrices (Model-View-Projection) managed by `webgl-utils.js` to position, orient, and scale each part.

*   **Trail Effects (Particles):**
    The `trail-effects.js` module defines "spawner" functions for each effect type. When a snake moves (and depending on the effect chosen in `skinData`), `game-main.js` periodically calls the appropriate spawn function. This function generates data for one or more particles (initial position, velocity, lifespan, color, size, type). These particles are stored in the `particles` array of the player object. The rendering loop (`game-renderer.js`) updates the position and opacity of each particle and draws them (often as simple quads with additive blending for glow effects).

*   **Real-time Communication (Socket.IO & Alternatives):**
    Socket.IO is currently used for bidirectional communication. It handles sending client inputs, broadcasting the game state (via AoI), notifications, etc.
    *   **Client -> Server:** `mouse_move`, `boost`, `joinGame`, `clientCollisionDetected` (`low` mode), admin actions...
    *   **Server -> Client(s):** `state`, `leaderboard`, `gameOver` (with i18next keys), `mapSizeUpdate`, `adminMessage`, various notifications (with i18next keys)...
    *   **Scalability:** For a very large number of concurrent players, Socket.IO (based on TCP) could become a bottleneck. Alternatives like **WebRTC** (for P2P or via SFU) or **WebTransport** (based on HTTP/3 and QUIC, allowing unreliable and ordered/unordered UDP streams) could offer superior performance but would significantly complicate the network architecture.

*   **Collision Detection & Security Modes (`high`, `medium`, `low`):**
    The server can operate in three distinct security modes, configurable via `config.json` or the admin panel (`/admin`), primarily affecting collision handling and anti-cheat:
    *   **`high` Mode:** This mode offers the highest level of security and fairness.
        *   **Head-Body Collision:** Detection is performed **server-side** authoritatively for **all players** (including admins playing normally). Dedicated workers (`collisionWorker.js`) calculate the distance between a player's head and the **line segments** forming the trail of nearby opponents (point-segment detection, more precise). The server solely determines if a collision occurred.
        *   **Anti-Cheat (Teleportation):** The server uses a **standard** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR`) to detect suspicious movements for all players.
        *   **Usage:** Recommended for situations requiring maximum cheat prevention, though it may impose a higher server load with many players.
    *   **`medium` Mode (Recommended for Production):** This mode provides a balance between security and performance by trusting admin players for their own collision detection.
        *   **Head-Body Collision (Non-Admins):** Detection for non-admin players is performed **server-side** authoritatively via workers, similar to `high` mode.
        *   **Head-Body Collision (Admins):** Admin players (when not in ghost mode) perform their own collision detection **client-side**. If an admin's client detects a collision for the admin, it sends a `clientCollisionDetected` message to the server, which then trusts this message. This reduces server load for admin players.
        *   **Anti-Cheat (Teleportation):** The server uses a **standard** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR`) for non-admin players and an **increased** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR * 1.2`) for admin players, making it slightly more lenient for admins regarding potential lag-induced "teleports".
        *   **Usage:** This is the **recommended mode for most production environments** as it maintains server-side authority for regular players while offloading some computation for trusted admin users, offering a good compromise. üëç
    *   **`low` Mode (Client + Lightweight / Insecure):** This mode delegates most collision logic to the client to significantly reduce server load, at the cost of security.
        *   **Head-Body Collision:** Detection is performed **client-side** for **all players** (`game-main.js`). The player's browser checks if its own head touches the points of other players' trails (point-point detection, less precise). If a collision is detected, the client sends a `clientCollisionDetected` message to the server. **The server trusts this message** and triggers the player's death without performing its own collision check via workers.
        *   **Anti-Cheat (Teleportation):** The server uses an **increased** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR * 1.2`) for all players to detect suspicious movements, reducing the risk of kicking legitimate players due to lag but making cheat detection less effective.
        *   **Usage:** Primarily intended for **debugging**, testing, or private games among trusted players. **This mode is inherently insecure and highly vulnerable to cheating**, as a modified client can simply choose not to send the collision message. ‚ö†Ô∏è
    *   **Optimization (Workers & Spatial Grid):** In `high` and `medium` modes (for non-admins), the server uses a `SpatialGrid` to optimize nearby entity searches. This data is then sent to `worker_threads` for precise head-body collision calculations, avoiding blocking the main Node.js thread.

*   **Skin System:**
    Skin information is stored in the `skinData` object within `accounts.json` for registered players.
    ```json
    "skinData": {
      "bodyType": "pattern", // "single" or "pattern"
      "bodyColor": "#44ff00", // Base color or for 'single' type
      "patternColors": ["#b739f4", "#9fc93f", ...], // Array of colors for 'pattern'
      "trailEffect": "glitch" // Name of the trail effect
    }
    ```
    This data is sent to the client during `joinGame` (for logged-in players) or directly by the client (for temporary players). The server includes it in `state` messages. The client (`game-renderer.js`) uses `skinData` to choose how to draw the body (single color or alternating `patternColors`), and `game-main.js` uses it to trigger the correct particle effect via `trail-effects.js`. The head color (`headColor`) is stored separately in `accounts.json` but managed alongside `skinData` in forms and the `/updateSkin` API.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Future Ideas
This project is a solid foundation, but here are some potential improvements and planned fixes:

### ‚úÖ To-Do (Priority)
*   **Optimization & Scalability:**
    *   [ ] **Socket Performance:** Evaluate and potentially enhance the Socket.IO server's capacity to handle a large number of concurrent players. ([Issue #2](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/2))
        *   *Ideas:* Node.js profiling, message optimization (frequency, size, binary format?), clustering Node.js, consider WebTransport/WebRTC for >1000 player scenarios?
    *   [ ] **AoI (Area of Interest) Precision:** Currently, AoI only considers the *head* position of other players. A player whose tail is the only part within the AoI won't be visible, potentially causing unfair deaths. ([Issue #3](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/3))
        *   *Approach 1:* Send the full data of a player as soon as *any* part of their body (trail) enters the client's AoI. Simple but potentially higher bandwidth usage.
        *   *Approach 2:* Send only the *part* of the trail that is visible within the AoI. More complex to manage server and client-side (truncating/reconstructing trails) but more bandwidth-efficient.
*   **UI (User Interface):**
    *   [ ] **Simplify Main Menu:** Reorganize/group buttons for a less cluttered and more intuitive interface. ([Issue #4](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/4))
*   **Gameplay:**
    *   [ ] **Improve Collision Detection Accuracy & Bot Collisions:** Address inaccuracies with player tail collisions and significantly bugged bot collisions. ([Issue #1](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/1))
    *   [ ] **Boost Particle Consistency:** Particles generated during boost should have the same appearance/type as standard food or be a distinct but visually consistent type.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):**
    *   [ ] **Expand Language Support:** Add translations for over 15 new languages to reach a broader global audience. ([Issue #9](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/9))

### ‚è≥ Future Improvements (Lower Priority)
*   [ ] **Rendering Engine Migration:**
    *   [ ] Explore migrating the client-side rendering from the current custom WebGL implementation to a dedicated game framework like **Phaser**. ([Issue #5](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/5))
    *   *Rationale:* Phaser could simplify development (scene management, sprites, physics helpers), potentially offer comparable or better performance depending on usage, and benefit from a larger community and ecosystem. This would involve a significant refactor of `game-renderer.js`, `webgl-utils.js`, and parts of `game-main.js`.
*   [ ] **Advanced Gameplay:**
    *   [ ] Add optional power-ups (temporary invincibility, food magnet, etc.) configurable via the admin panel. ([Issue #6](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/6))
    *   [ ] Create a Battle Royale mode with a progressively shrinking zone. ([Issue #7](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/7))
*   [ ] **Code Refactoring & Cleanup:**
    *   [ ] Full code review to improve comments (in English), remove obsolete development comments. ([Issue #8](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/8))
    *   [ ] Ensure consistent JSDoc documentation for important functions.
    *   [ ] Standardize code style further if necessary.
*   [ ] **Visual Enhancements:**
    *   [ ] **Improved Godmode Shield Effect:** Enhance the visual feedback for the temporary godmode/shield active at spawn. Instead of a static overlay that disappears abruptly, implement a pulsing shield effect. The pulse could start slower (e.g., once per second) and gradually increase in frequency as the godmode duration nears its end, culminating in a more distinct "fade-out" or "shatter" effect. This would provide clearer and more dynamic feedback to the player about their invulnerability status and its remaining time. ([Issue #11])

## ü§î Creator's Note & Contributions
This project is a personal adventure into web game development, largely achieved with the help of AI (Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and its impressive ability to handle large code contexts!). I'm not a professional developer, just an enthusiast tinkering and learning by doing. üòÖ

The code isn't perfect by the strictest professional standards, but it works and integrates an impressive number of features, including full internationalization. The main goal was to explore possibilities and have fun.
