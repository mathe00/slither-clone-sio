**üîß Architecture & Tech Stack:**

- **Modular Node.js Backend:** Organized code (`apiRoutes.js`, `gameLogic.js`, `socketHandlers.js`, `serverLifecycle.js`). **Sends i18next keys** to the client for localized messages.
- **Modular JavaScript Client:** Separated logic (`game-main.js`, `game-renderer.js`, `webgl-utils.js`, `ui-logic.js`, `sound-manager.js`, `trail-effects.js`, `admin-logic.js`). **`ui-logic.js` and `admin-logic.js` handle i18next initialization and UI text rendering.**
- **Clean Express API:** Dedicated routes for authentication, customization, administration. **API responses use i18next keys for feedback.**
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - `worker_threads` for intensive collision calculations.
  - Spatial Grid (`SpatialGrid`) to optimize nearby entity searches.
  - Area of Interest (AoI): Only sends relevant data around the client.
  - Optimized WebGL rendering.
- **Server Lifecycle Management:** Clean startup/shutdown, `server.lock` management.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Server and game settings managed via `config.json`.
- **Data Persistence:** Accounts (`accounts.json`) and sessions (`sessions.json`) saved.
- **Internationalization:** `i18next` library with JSON files in `/public/locales/`.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Service Worker (`service-worker.js`) caches core assets, **including locale files and i18next libraries**, for offline functionality (localized offline page).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Deep Dive

Some key mechanisms explained:

- **Snake Rendering (WebGL):**
  Each snake is represented by an array of segments (`trail`). The current WebGL renderer (`game-renderer.js`) draws each segment as a colored quad. The size of the segments (`segmentRadius`) and head (`headRadius`) is calculated dynamically based on the player's `maxTrailLength` (logarithmically for a pleasant visual effect). Eyes are also drawn procedurally as overlapping quads. Rendering uses matrices (Model-View-Projection) managed by `webgl-utils.js` to position, orient, and scale each part.

- **Trail Effects (Particles):**
  The `trail-effects.js` module defines "spawner" functions for each effect type. When a snake moves (and depending on the effect chosen in `skinData`), `game-main.js` periodically calls the appropriate spawn function. This function generates data for one or more particles (initial position, velocity, lifespan, color, size, type). These particles are stored in the `particles` array of the player object. The rendering loop (`game-renderer.js`) updates the position and opacity of each particle and draws them (often as simple quads with additive blending for glow effects).

- **Real-time Communication (Socket.IO & Alternatives):**
  Socket.IO is currently used for bidirectional communication. It handles sending client inputs, broadcasting the game state (via AoI), notifications, etc.
  - **Client -> Server:** `mouse_move`, `boost`, `joinGame`, `clientCollisionDetected` (`low` mode), admin actions...
  - **Server -> Client(s):** `state`, `leaderboard`, `gameOver` (with i18next keys), `mapSizeUpdate`, `adminMessage`, various notifications (with i18next keys)...
  - **Scalability:** For a very large number of concurrent players, Socket.IO (based on TCP) could become a bottleneck. Alternatives like **WebRTC** (for P2P or via SFU) or **WebTransport** (based on HTTP/3 and QUIC, allowing unreliable and ordered/unordered UDP streams) could offer superior performance but would significantly complicate the network architecture.

- **Collision Detection & Security Modes (`high`, `medium`, `low`):**
  The server can operate in three distinct security modes, configurable via `config.json` or the admin panel (`/admin`), primarily affecting collision handling and anti-cheat:
  - **`high` Mode:** This mode offers the highest level of security and fairness.
    - **Head-Body Collision:** Detection is performed **server-side** authoritatively for **all players** (including admins playing normally). Dedicated workers (`collisionWorker.js`) calculate the distance between a player's head and the **line segments** forming the trail of nearby opponents (point-segment detection, more precise). The server solely determines if a collision occurred.
    - **Anti-Cheat (Teleportation):** The server uses a **standard** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR`) to detect suspicious movements for all players.
    - **Usage:** Recommended for situations requiring maximum cheat prevention, though it may impose a higher server load with many players.
  - **`medium` Mode (Recommended for Production):** This mode provides a balance between security and performance by trusting admin players for their own collision detection.
    - **Head-Body Collision (Non-Admins):** Detection for non-admin players is performed **server-side** authoritatively via workers, similar to `high` mode.
    - **Head-Body Collision (Admins):** Admin players (when not in ghost mode) perform their own collision detection **client-side**. If an admin's client detects a collision for the admin, it sends a `clientCollisionDetected` message to the server, which then trusts this message. This reduces server load for admin players.
    - **Anti-Cheat (Teleportation):** The server uses a **standard** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR`) for non-admin players and an **increased** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR * 1.2`) for admin players, making it slightly more lenient for admins regarding potential lag-induced "teleports".
    - **Usage:** This is the **recommended mode for most production environments** as it maintains server-side authority for regular players while offloading some computation for trusted admin users, offering a good compromise. üëç
  - **`low` Mode (Client + Lightweight / Insecure):** This mode delegates most collision logic to the client to significantly reduce server load, at the cost of security.
    - **Head-Body Collision:** Detection is performed **client-side** for **all players** (`game-main.js`). The player's browser checks if its own head touches the points of other players' trails (point-point detection, less precise). If a collision is detected, the client sends a `clientCollisionDetected` message to the server. **The server trusts this message** and triggers the player's death without performing its own collision check via workers.
    - **Anti-Cheat (Teleportation):** The server uses an **increased** tolerance (`TELEPORT_TOLERANCE_FACTOR * 1.2`) for all players to detect suspicious movements, reducing the risk of kicking legitimate players due to lag but making cheat detection less effective.
    - **Usage:** Primarily intended for **debugging**, testing, or private games among trusted players. **This mode is inherently insecure and highly vulnerable to cheating**, as a modified client can simply choose not to send the collision message. ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - **Optimization (Workers & Spatial Grid):** In `high` and `medium` modes (for non-admins), the server uses a `SpatialGrid` to optimize nearby entity searches. This data is then sent to `worker_threads` for precise head-body collision calculations, avoiding blocking the main Node.js thread.

- **Skin System:**
  Skin information is stored in the `skinData` object within `accounts.json` for registered players.
  ```json
  "skinData": {
    "bodyType": "pattern", // "single" or "pattern"
    "bodyColor": "#44ff00", // Base color or for 'single' type
    "patternColors": ["#b739f4", "#9fc93f", ...], // Array of colors for 'pattern'
    "trailEffect": "glitch" // Name of the trail effect
  }
  ```
  This data is sent to the client during `joinGame` (for logged-in players) or directly by the client (for temporary players). The server includes it in `state` messages. The client (`game-renderer.js`) uses `skinData` to choose how to draw the body (single color or alternating `patternColors`), and `game-main.js` uses it to trigger the correct particle effect via `trail-effects.js`. The head color (`headColor`) is stored separately in `accounts.json` but managed alongside `skinData` in forms and the `/updateSkin` API.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Future Ideas

This project is a solid foundation, but here are some potential improvements and planned fixes:

### ‚úÖ To-Do (Priority)

- **Optimization & Scalability:**
  - [ ] **Socket Performance:** Evaluate and potentially enhance the Socket.IO server's capacity to handle a large number of concurrent players. ([Issue #2](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/2))
    - _Ideas:_ Node.js profiling, message optimization (frequency, size, binary format?), clustering Node.js, consider WebTransport/WebRTC for >1000 player scenarios?
  - [ ] **AoI (Area of Interest) Precision:** Currently, AoI only considers the _head_ position of other players. A player whose tail is the only part within the AoI won't be visible, potentially causing unfair deaths. ([Issue #3](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/3))
    - _Approach 1:_ Send the full data of a player as soon as _any_ part of their body (trail) enters the client's AoI. Simple but potentially higher bandwidth usage.
    - _Approach 2:_ Send only the _part_ of the trail that is visible within the AoI. More complex to manage server and client-side (truncating/reconstructing trails) but more bandwidth-efficient.
- **UI (User Interface):**
  - [ ] **Simplify Main Menu:** Reorganize/group buttons for a less cluttered and more intuitive interface. ([Issue #4](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/4))
- **Gameplay:**
  - [ ] **Improve Collision Detection Accuracy & Bot Collisions:** Address inaccuracies with player tail collisions and significantly bugged bot collisions. ([Issue #1](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/1))
  - [ ] **Boost Particle Consistency:** Particles generated during boost should have the same appearance/type as standard food or be a distinct but visually consistent type.
- **Internationalization (i18n):**
  - [ ] **Expand Language Support:** Add translations for over 15 new languages to reach a broader global audience. ([Issue #9](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/9))
  - [ ] **Implement Full Right-to-Left (RTL) Layout Support:** Adapt HTML and CSS for languages like Arabic, Persian, Urdu. ([Issue #10](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/10))
- **Visual Enhancements:**
  - [ ] **Improved Godmode Shield Effect:** Enhance the visual feedback for the temporary godmode/shield active at spawn with a dynamic pulsing effect. ([Issue #11](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/11))
- **Server-Side Robustness & Security:**
  - [ ] **Implement Robust Server-Side Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate all data received from clients via Socket.IO and HTTP APIs. ([Issue #12](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/12))
  - [ ] **Enhance Error Handling in Server Game Loop:** Implement more comprehensive `try...catch` blocks in `gameLogic.js` to prevent crashes from isolated entity errors. ([Issue #13](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/13))
  - [ ] **Implement Atomic File Saving Strategy:** Ensure `accounts.json`, `sessions.json`, and `config.json` are saved atomically to prevent data corruption. ([Issue #14](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/14))
  - [ ] **Implement Structured Server Logging with Levels:** Transition from `console.log` to a structured logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino) for better debugging and monitoring. ([Issue #15](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/15))

### ‚è≥ Future Improvements (Lower Priority)

- [ ] **Rendering Engine Migration:**
  - [ ] Explore migrating the client-side rendering from the current custom WebGL implementation to a dedicated game framework like **Phaser**. ([Issue #5](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/5))
  - _Rationale:_ Phaser could simplify development (scene management, sprites, physics helpers), potentially offer comparable or better performance depending on usage, and benefit from a larger community and ecosystem. This would involve a significant refactor of `game-renderer.js`, `webgl-utils.js`, and parts of `game-main.js`.
- [ ] **Advanced Gameplay:**
  - [ ] Add optional power-ups (temporary invincibility, food magnet, etc.) configurable via the admin panel. ([Issue #6](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/6))
  - [ ] Create a Battle Royale mode with a progressively shrinking zone. ([Issue #7](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/7))
- [ ] **Code Refactoring & Cleanup:**
  - [ ] Full code review to improve comments (in English), remove obsolete development comments. ([Issue #8](https://github.com/mathe00/slither-clone-sio/issues/8))
  - [ ] Ensure consistent JSDoc documentation for important functions.
  - [ ] Standardize code style further if necessary.

**Why "Slither Clone SIO"?**  
Well, because! üòâ Let's just say the reason is a well-kept secret.

**Future Maintenance?**  
Honestly, I'm not sure. I don't have specific plans to maintain it actively. If I get a bit bored and inspiration strikes, maybe! But for now, consider it a snapshot of a fun experiment.

**The "Why" Behind This Project:**  
It all started because I was bored and wanted to play Slither with friends. Trying to meet up for 1v1s on public servers for these kinds of games is a hassle. So, I thought, "Why not self-host?" I looked around for existing clones, but what I found was often old, a bit clunky, lacked features, and most importantly, didn't have multiplayer.

So, I decided to build this one, heavily leveraging AI because, as you might guess from my other GitHub repos, I'm not a traditional developer. I use AI extensively to bring these projects to life, and hey, it works! That's what counts, right? üòâ I know this approach sometimes raises eyebrows among "purist" developers who aren't fans of non-devs like me building things this way, but the journey and the result are what matter to me.

**Current State & Thoughts on Public Release:**  
Right now, I don't think the project is ready for a large-scale public deployment. It's fantastic for having fun with friends in a self-hosted environment. I've poured dozens of hours into it, and if you feel like contributing to make it better, or even supporting me a little financially to help offset some of the AI API/token costs I've incurred, that would be amazing (see the Support section below!).

For a truly public-ready version, it would need a more polished codebase ‚Äì perhaps migrating to TypeScript for better maintainability. More critically, I believe the reliance on Socket.IO, while great for smaller groups, wouldn't be performant enough to handle a massive number of concurrent players. Even though I've tried to optimize and introduce security modes that shift some load/trust to the client, a different networking approach would likely be necessary for large-scale play.

**Contributions are welcome!** If you're an experienced developer (or even a motivated beginner!) and see areas for improvement, bugs to fix, or want to implement one of the roadmap ideas (like the Phaser migration or a networking overhaul!), feel free to open an _Issue_ or a _Pull Request_ on the GitHub repository. Your help would be greatly appreciated! üôè
